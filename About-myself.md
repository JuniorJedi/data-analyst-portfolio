# Ester Pinna - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About myself
Hi there! I'm Ester :) **I come from a background in social media advertising**, where I've honed an analytical mindset and a critical approach. Currently, I'm transitioning into the world of data analysis, eager to merge my technical skills with marketing insights to craft optimized business strategies.

My academic journey spans both **scientific and humanities studies**, giving me the versatility needed to tackle complex numerical problems, statistical analysis, graph interpretation, and data-driven understanding of user mentality and behavior. These are areas I'm passionate about diving deeper into within data analysis.

In my free time, my curiosity drives me to uncover the 'why' behind numbers, diving into new tools and languages for data analysis. I'm always on the lookout to expand my knowledge and skills. 
**My empathetic nature often leads me to valuable insights, as I naturally put myself in the user's shoes**, enhancing my ability to communicate complex data in an accessible way, even to those without any background in it.

I thrive in collaborative environments, valuing teamwork and the collective pursuit of new discoveries. I'm committed to continuous learning and tackling the challenges of solving complex problems, whether working in a team or independently.

My personal interests align closely with my professional aspirations because **I want to dedicate my time to what I'm passionate about**. I'm fascinated by the stories data can tell about human behavior and am always seeking ways to translate these narratives into actionable strategies.
